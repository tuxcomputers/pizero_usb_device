# To configure the Pi Zero so you can access as if it has a network connection

If you have a Raspberry Pi Zero W you already have WiFi built in it can access your WiFi network and you can access it across the WiFi.

If you have the Raspberry Pi Zero without WiFi you can still access it using a program like [Putty](https://putty.org/) by configuring it to emulate a network connection across the USB cable.

With this config you will also be able to access the internet from your Pi Zero to do updates etc.
